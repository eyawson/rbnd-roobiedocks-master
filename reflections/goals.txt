My goal as a developer is to finally get employed doing something I love to do. I have loved Ruby for a while and I am
mighty glad Udacity started this. My goal is to learn as much as I can to be able to apply it in the ideas that come to mind.
I have a social media web app in  mind I have been rolling over inmy head so I will be able to aplly these skills I'm learning
from to develop the app.
